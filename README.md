Abstract 
-----------
In fantasy football, preseason player rankings are perhaps the greatest indicator of draft capital spent building a fantasy roster. There is substantial demand for these rankings, as they give drafters a simple way to assess a players value under time pressure and give them a sense of how competitors will value players. However, these rankings are less than perfect. Most fantasy football managers have a story of when they assembled a roster of highly ranked players only to see them underperform expecations during the season. This raises questions about the accuracy of preseason rankings, and how much trust to put into them. In this analysis, I determine how well rankings predict in-season performance for each position group and assess the implications for fantasy managers.
